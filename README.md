# ML-Project
The Rock vs Mine Prediction project is a machine learning–based classification system designed to identify whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine using sonar signal data. This problem is critical in naval defense and marine exploration, where accurate object detection helps prevent accidental collisions and improves maritime safety.
