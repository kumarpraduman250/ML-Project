# ML-Project

The Rock vs Mine Prediction project is a machine learning–based classification system designed to identify whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine using sonar signal data. This problem is critical in naval defense and marine exploration, where accurate object detection helps prevent accidental collisions and improves maritime safety.

The model analyzes sonar signal patterns reflected from objects and applies supervised learning algorithms to classify them into two categories: Rock (R) or Mine (M).

# How It Works

Sonar waves are emitted underwater and reflected back by objects

Reflected signals are converted into numerical feature values

A machine learning classifier learns patterns from labeled data

The trained model predicts whether the object is a rock or a mine
